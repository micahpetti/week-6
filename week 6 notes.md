week 6 note

Roman Networks ipynb: Files/links giving errors can be opened in browser by copy and pasting. 

Error when defining variable 'G' NameError: name 'nx' is not defined. google says it needs to be defined as a variable. I did not downlaod mapping stuff properly. make sure '--- download as ----' is completed 

See the top 5 cities by degree. Delos and Rhodos have double the degrees of the others in the top 5. 

How does it group communities??? algorithms determine what closeness/interactive/edges make a point psrt of one group or another. 

community.greedy_modularity_communities: idk

 modularity score closer 1= more accurate. 

for [[graveyardwk6.ipynb]] copy paste data to make file. 2 files must be created one with Nodes and other with Edges
